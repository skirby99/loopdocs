<p>When you are initially starting the Loop app, the Loop will be colored grey.  Wait about 15-20 minutes for the Loop to turn from grey to green.  There's a bit of time for Loop to pull all of those first pieces of data together, especially reading your pump history for the first time.  If the Loop remains grey after 15-20 min, there are several possible causes for this.  If you find yourself with a grey loop that just won't turn green, check these most frequently missed items on new setups:</p>
<h2 id="pump">Pump<a class="headerlink" href="#pump" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Max basal rate in Loop app is no greater than the max basal rate in pump settings</li>
<li>Temp basal type in the pump's basal menu is set to "Insulin Rate (U/hr)" and not "Percent of Basal"</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cgm">CGM<a class="headerlink" href="#cgm" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Dexcom app installed on the looping iPhone and open</li>
<li>CGM getting current values without interruption</li>
<li>Loop app has a CGM value displayed in the top bar of the main display</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rileylink">RileyLink<a class="headerlink" href="#rileylink" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>RL is charged (it does not ship completely charged)</li>
<li>RL battery needs to be securely plugged in, <a href="https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/setup/requirements/rileylink/#assembling-rl">check those connections</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loop-settings">Loop Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#loop-settings" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Correct CGM system has been selected in Loop settings</li>
<li>Insulin curve has been selected</li>
<li>Suspend Threshold has been entered</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition info">
<p>The most common delay in getting a grey loop to turn green is probably the lack of CGM data.  If you have waited 15-20 minutes and no CGM data has appeared, try closing both the Loop and Dexcom apps (double-tap home button and up-swipe to close apps).  Toggle your BT on iPhone off/on.  Reopen the Loop app, then reopen Dexcom app.</p>
</div>
<p>If all else fails after verifying the settings listed in the sections above, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close and restart the Loop and Dexcom apps</li>
<li>Toggle BT off/on</li>
<li>Turn RileyLink off/on</li>
<li>Replace pump battery</li>
</ul></div>
